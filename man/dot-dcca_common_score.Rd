\arguments{
\item{cca_res}{returned object from \code{.cca}}

\item{cell_max}{number of cells used to compute the distinct percentaage}

\item{check_alignment}{boolean. If \code{TRUE}, recompute \code{score_1} and \code{score_2}
after using \code{.compute_unnormalized_scores}. This might be needed if the \code{.cca} solution
was not computed from exactly \code{svd_1} and \code{svd_2}}

\item{fix_tilt_perc}{boolean or numeric between 0 and 1 (inclusive). If \code{TRUE}, the output \code{distinct_perc_2} will be fixed to at 0.5,
meaning the common scores will be the "middle" of \code{score_1} and \code{score_2}.
If \code{FALSE}, \code{distinct_perc_2} will be adaptively estimated via the
\code{.common_decomposition} function.}

\item{num_neigh}{number of neighbors to consider to computed the common percentage}

\item{svd_1}{SVD of the denoised variant of \code{mat_1} from \code{dcca_factor}}

\item{svd_2}{SVD of the denoised variant of \code{mat_2} from \code{dcca_factor}}

\description{
Given the two matrices (given by \code{svd_1} and \code{svd_2}) and the
CCA solution in \code{cca_res}, compute the common scores.
This calls the functions
\code{.common_decomposition} and \code{.compute_distinct_score}.
