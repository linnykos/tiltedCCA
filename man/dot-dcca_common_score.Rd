\arguments{
\item{cca_res}{returned object from \code{.cca}}

\item{cell_max}{positive integer for how many cells to subsample (useful if
\code{nrow(mat_1) is too large})}

\item{discretization_gridsize}{positive integer for how many values between 0 and 1 (inclusive) to search the 
appropriate amount of tilt over}

\item{enforce_boundary}{boolean, on whether or not the tilt is required to stay between
the two canonical score vectors}

\item{fix_tilt_perc}{boolean or a numeric. If \code{FALSE}, then the tilt is adaptively
determined, and if \code{TRUE}, then the tilt is set to be equal to 
\code{0.5}. If numeric, the value should be between \code{0} and \code{1},
which the tilt will be set to.}

\item{metacell_clustering_1}{\code{NA} or factor vector of length \code{nrow(mat_1)} that 
depicts the hard clustering structure of the cell
(with possible \code{NA}'s for cells that don't
conform to a hard clustering structure).}

\item{metacell_clustering_2}{\code{NA} or factor vector of length \code{nrow(mat_2)} that 
depicts the hard clustering structure of the cell
(with possible \code{NA}'s for cells that don't
conform to a hard clustering structure).}

\item{num_neigh}{number of neighbors to consider to computed the common percentage
(when calling \code{.determine_cluster})}

\item{svd_1}{SVD of the denoised variant of \code{mat_1} from \code{dcca_factor}}

\item{svd_2}{SVD of the denoised variant of \code{mat_2} from \code{dcca_factor}}

\item{verbose}{boolean}

\description{
Given the two matrices (given by \code{svd_1} and \code{svd_2}) and the
CCA solution in \code{cca_res}, compute the common scores.
This calls the functions
\code{.common_decomposition} and \code{.compute_distinct_score}.
